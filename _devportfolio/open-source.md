I've made contributions & created to a number of open source projects, both in my capacity as a product developer at My PT Hub and in my own time. I've contributed through updating docs, adding feature implementations and providing bug reports.

Most recently, I've been working on [integrations with Discord and Twitch APIs](./discord-projects) for the live-streaming community.

I've also previously participated in multiple [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/) events.
