Between 2019 and 2022 I worked with a number of streamers of varying audience sizes, including [partnered](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/partners/) streamers. As a moderator, I had a number of responsibilities:

* Building community engagement through running Discord events
* [Developing Twitch integrations](../projects/discord-twitch-projects) into Discord communities to boost "early viewer" engagement
* Creating a positive community atmosphere by filtering messages
* Running competitions and other events under tight deadlines
* Working with marketing partners to build effective and fun content using my audience knowledge
* Organising community events with other team members

My work with streamers has proven successful, with one partnered streamer increasing viewership 10-fold and the number of integrations many times over.
