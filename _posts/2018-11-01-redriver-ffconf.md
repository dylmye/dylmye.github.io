Back in November I had the privilege of attending my third FFConf. For the uninitiated, FFConf is an annual conference held in Brighton, England and is led by [Remy Sharp](https://remysharp.com/) of JSbin and nodemon fame. It's a great insight into the future of the web thanks to the diverse range of speakers. Here are some of the take aways I gained from the tenth installment of the conference.

# 1. AI-in-JS is a thing, and its future is looking bright

I was intrigued by [Elle Haproff](https://twitter.com/eleanorhaproff)'s talk about AI in client-side javascript. I've read about ML processing on cloud services previously, but it was really cool to see how capable browsers are when it comes to AI. Eleanor is one of the founders of the online showcase of these projects, [aijs.rocks](https://aijs.rocks), which features such projects as:

* **Nic or not**: A tensorflow.js project that determines whether your photos contain Nicolas Cage or not.
* **Emoji caption**: A computer vision project utilising Azure to generate captions for your Instagram pics.
* **image2image**: My personal favourite, a tensorflow.js project that turns your line drawings into surreal "photos". Based on Pix2Pix.

// something here about tensorflow.js and link back to eleanor's talk abt benefits, mention gpu.js, brainjs, propel //


notes
* tfjs on client or server
* featd examples: posenet, sketch rnn, pacman
