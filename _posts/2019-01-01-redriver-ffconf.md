Back in November I had the privilege of attending my third FFConf. For the uninitiated, FFConf is an annual conference held in Brighton, England and is led by [Remy Sharp](https://remysharp.com/) - of JSbin and nodemon fame - and his wife, [Julie](https://twitter.com/Julieanne). It's a great insight into the future of the web thanks to the diverse range of speakers. Here are some of the take aways I gained from the tenth installment of the conference.
