In late 2022, I worked with [Island Records](https://www.islandrecords.co.uk/) (UMG) and their social media agency to build a Discord community for the Leciester-based pop group Easy Life. I built up a space that was shaped for the community, previously centred on a Facebook group. Working closely with the band, we built up a set of spaces and planned events leading up to the release of their sophomore album, _Maybe In Another Life_ (MIAL.) I built up a team of fans to moderate the space, and used my advanced knowledge of Discord communities to set up bots to best serve the community.

I worked with the label and social media agency to help integrate the Discord community as a core part of the band's social media strategy, increasing fan loyalty and engagement. Merchandise and ticket sales also increased with the success of Discord marketing strategies. As part of the MIAL release, the band launched a Discord-exclusive limited variant of the album, on a USB drive. This release was especially popular with the community's dedicated fan core.

> Dylan has been instrumental in creating, growing and maintaining our Discord server. He helps keep our members engaged through creative uses of bots and features and events alongside our album campaign schedule.

The Discord community, now 3,200+ members strong, continues to be the most popular space for Easy Life fans to find other fans to meet at gigs, make friends, engage with the band and more. Members enjoy exclusive perks for their loyalty, including merchandise discounts, being first in line for ticket presales and more.
